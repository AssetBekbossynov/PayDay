People with poor credit are a natural clientele for payday loans. The borrower can apply for the loan, and not be at all concerned that his credit is either ugly or nonexistent.
People with little or no savings represent another natural market. Most households in America live on a paycheck-to-paycheck basis. A 2016 survey by Go Banking Rates found that 69% of American households have less than $1,000 in savings. That demonstrates the enormous potential market for payday loans, and why theyâ€™re so stubbornly popular.
Since bad credit and a lack of savings often go hand-in-hand, payday lenders have a built-in market.
While many people can get by based on the regular expenses, an emergency situation creates a need for immediate cash.
For example, a person with bad credit and no savings has car trouble, and finds that it will take $700 to fix it. They need the car to get to work, and since they have no available credit and no savings, they turn to payday lenders. They may have no idea how to come up with $700 (plus interest) in two weeks, but the loan buys them some time.
According to the Pew Charitable Trusts 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, spending $9 billion on loan fees.
Payday loans are used in place of emergency savings accounts, although the trust has found that many also use them for regular living expenses.
